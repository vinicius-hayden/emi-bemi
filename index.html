        <h2>HOLY. MOLY. 6 MONTHS!</h2>
        <p>Man, that’s half a year! Isn’t that insane? Time really did fly by. I wanted to start this by saying how important you are to me. Past few days have been very depressing, with little to-no signs of my day even getting close to actually getting better.</p>
        <p>The thought of calling you that day was like a pain killer, instantly. There I was, making silly little comments with you, and all of that so-called pain felt like it was never there in the first place.</p>
        <p>And so it has been like that for, when I look back, a grateful amount of times. It’s crazy to think how fast we came to be what we are. I am grateful for everything you taught and teach me daily. There’s so much I want to tell you but you know words wouldn’t be able to make it half what I really want to tell you, or feel.</p>
        <p>The reason why I appreciate all of that is because I know I must be hard to be around sometimes, especially during our trip in Brazil. I showed you a part of me I am not the proudest of, but I promise you, I am always working to be a better person. The goal of this of course is for me first, but being a better boyfriend is a very good bonus.</p>
        <p>Enough with the little rant, I want to become a better version of myself because you deserve a better Vini and I am in that process!!!</p>
        <p>Well, I could spend hours here talking about how crazy you make me feel, whether it’s freaky beaky or just straight up making me crack up laughing. You see? That’s why I like our relationship so much man! The good stuff, it’s always there, it’s part of who we are.</p>
        <p>The way you make me feel, whether being loved, or simply just being, I know you won’t judge me. The slightest thought of you makes my day. Having you as my partner really makes me grateful for everything, thank you, thank you.</p>
        <p>There is this feeling, the one before seeing you, it’s like that pre-sentiment before and during the rollercoaster fall. The adrenaline consumes my body, the desire to see you, to hug you, to call you gorgeous, to look at your eyes. It becomes me, only in that moment, I can truly say I am at peace. I know I am going to see you.</p>
        <p>Let’s celebrate this once more, as I write this I can’t wait to see your pretty face and hold your hands, say to you all that silly stuff that you deeply know what it really means. Just like you, the whole world, the world universe, the cosmos, you. I love you Emi.</p>
        <h3>Happy 6 months</h3>
        <h4>Vini</h4>
